## Project Overview
The Earthquake Detection Model aims to identify seismic activities using sensor data collected from accelerometers and seismographs. This project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest Classifier, to classify data as either "normal" or indicative of an earthquake.

## Methodology

### Concept Explanation
Earthquakes produce vibrations that can be detected by sensors. These sensors measure various parameters such as acceleration (Accel_X, Accel_Y, Accel_Z) and seismic readings (Seismo_Reading). The model leverages these features to predict whether an event is an earthquake or normal activity. 

### Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Data Sources**: Data is sourced from various seismic monitoring systems, aggregated into a structured format.
- **Data Structure**: The dataset consists of multiple features:
    - **Time**: Timestamp of the recorded data.
    - **Accel_X, Accel_Y, Accel_Z**: Acceleration values measured in g (gravitational force).
    - **Seismo_Reading**: Seismic reading from the sensors.
    - **Label**: Indicates whether the recorded event is normal (0) or an earthquake (1).
- **Label Encoding**: Labels are encoded as integers (0 for normal and 1 for earthquake).
- **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets using a stratified split to maintain the balance between classes.

### Model Training and Validation
- **Model Selection**: A Random Forest Classifier is chosen due to its effectiveness in handling imbalanced datasets and its robustness against overfitting.
- **Scaling**: Features are standardized using `StandardScaler` to improve model performance.
- **Resampling**: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is used to balance the classes in the training set.
- **Validation**: The model's performance is evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics on the validation dataset.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Grid Search**: Hyperparameters such as the number of estimators, max depth, minimum samples split, and minimum samples leaf are tuned using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

## Understanding Earthquake Magnitudes

### Richter Scale
The Richter scale, developed by Charles F. Richter in 1935, quantifies the amount of energy released during an earthquake (its magnitude). The scale is logarithmic, meaning each whole number increase on the Richter scale represents a tenfold increase in measured amplitude and approximately 31.6 times more energy release.

### Sensor Types and Measurements
To determine whether an earthquake has occurred based on sensor data, it's essential to understand the thresholds and units commonly used for seismic sensors. Here's a breakdown of key sensor types, their outputs, and typical thresholds for identifying earthquakes:

1. **Accelerometers**
   - **Units**: Typically measured in **g** (acceleration due to gravity), where \(1 g \approx 9.81 \, m/s^2\). Some sensors may also output in **m/s²** directly.
   - **Thresholds**:
     - **Low Magnitude Earthquakes**: Generally, an acceleration above **0.1 g** may be noticeable as a small quake. This is the lower limit where vibrations can be felt.
     - **Moderate Earthquakes**: An acceleration between **0.2 g and 0.5 g** typically indicates a moderate earthquake that can be felt.
     - **Strong Earthquakes**: An acceleration of **greater than 0.5 g** often indicates a strong earthquake that may cause damage.

2. **Seismographs**
   - **Units**: These sensors measure ground motion and typically report in **displacement** (meters), **velocity** (m/s), or **acceleration** (g or m/s²).
   - **Thresholds**:
     - **Intensity Levels**: Seismographs use the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale to describe the intensity of shaking. 
       - **Minor earthquakes** (e.g., M < 3) may not cause noticeable shaking.
       - **Light earthquakes** (M 3-4) are felt by many but usually do not cause damage.
       - **Moderate earthquakes** (M 4-5) can cause damage in populated areas.
       - **Strong earthquakes** (M > 5) can cause serious damage.

3. **Seismic Networks**
   - **Magnitude Measurement**: Seismic networks often report magnitude on the Richter scale or Moment Magnitude scale (Mw). 
     - **Magnitude 2-3**: Generally not felt.
     - **Magnitude 4**: Generally felt by people, but rarely causes damage.
     - **Magnitude 5-6**: Can cause damage, especially in populated areas.
     - **Magnitude 7 or higher**: Can cause significant destruction.

### Summary of Thresholds and Units
| Sensor Type      | Units       | Threshold for Noticeable Earthquake |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| Accelerometer     | g (m/s²)   | >0.1 g (small), >0.2 g (moderate), >0.5 g (strong) |
| Seismograph       | m, m/s, g  | M > 3 (minor), M 4-5 (moderate), M > 5 (strong) |
| Seismic Network    | Magnitude  | M < 3 (not felt), M 4-5 (minor damage), M > 5 (significant damage) |

### Key Considerations
- **Location**: The effects of an earthquake can vary based on proximity to the epicenter, local geology, and building structures.
- **Duration**: The duration of shaking can also be a factor in assessing the potential for damage.
- **Sensor Calibration**: Ensure that sensors are calibrated correctly to give accurate readings for analysis.

### Magnitude Comparison
A seismograph can convert sensor readings into a magnitude value on the Richter scale or Moment Magnitude scale (Mw). Here are rough estimates of ground acceleration and Richter scale magnitudes:

| **Richter Scale Magnitude** | **Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) in g** | **Description**                          |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **0-2**                       | < 0.001 g                                | Micro; not felt                          |
| **2-3**                       | 0.001 - 0.01 g                           | Minor; often not felt                   |
| **3-4**                       | 0.01 - 0.1 g                             | Light; felt by many, but rarely causes damage |
| **4-5**                       | 0.1 - 0.3 g                              | Moderate; can cause damage in populated areas |
| **5-6**                       | 0.3 - 0.5 g                              | Strong; can cause significant damage     |
| **6-7**                       | 0.5 - 1.0 g                              | Major; can cause severe damage           |
| **7-8**                       | 1.0 - 2.0 g                              | Great; widespread, severe damage         |
| **8+**                        | > 2.0 g                                  | Mega; catastrophic damage possible       |
